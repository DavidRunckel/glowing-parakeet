IMPORTANT NOTE: This project was from my CS1302 course so while all the code regarding making the application function is my intellectual property, the concept was derived from instructiion provided by Dr. Barnes (Bradley J. Barnes) and Dr. Cotterell (Michael E. Cotterell).

This project under the code name "glowing parakeet" is a GUI application that queries the iTunes database to display images regarding the searched text through JavaFX. "glowing parakeet" is used to disguise the project so as a public repository, current CS1302 students cannot easily access the code.

The project highlights my understanding primarily of JavaFX and how to read and understand public  API's. While that is the core of the project, the finer details of how I applied my knowledge of threads to ensure smooth operations of the application for the user is also highlighted. This was also one of the first projects we utilized Maven to make compiling our source code simpler.

The primary portion of the code is isolated within GalleryApp.java while the 2 iTunes java files are utilized to send out the query to the iTunes API database and return data.
